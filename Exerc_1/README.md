![Exercise 1 Output](./Screenshot%202025-12-06%20162739.png)

## Description
This exercise calculates the sum of the first N terms of the harmonic series.

## What it does
The program prompts the user to enter the number of terms (N) and computes the sum:
```
H(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/n
```

## Input
- N: The number of terms to calculate in the harmonic series

## Output
- The sum of the first N terms of the harmonic series

## Example
```
How much N term are : 5
THe sum of these 5 first terms of the harmonical serie are : 2.283333333333333
```
