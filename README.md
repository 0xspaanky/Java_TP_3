## Exercises Overview

### Exercise 1: Harmonic Series
Calculates the sum of the first N terms of the harmonic series: H(n) = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n

**Key Concepts:** Loops, mathematical series, floating-point arithmetic

### Exercise 2: Centered Star Triangle
Displays a centered triangle pattern using asterisks with a given height.

**Key Concepts:** Nested loops, pattern printing, spacing calculation

### Exercise 3: Odd Squares
Calculates and displays the squares of the first N odd numbers using arrays.

**Key Concepts:** Arrays, odd number sequences, mathematical operations

### Exercise 4: Double Array Utilities
Implements utility methods for 2D array (matrix) operations including:
- Display matrix
- Check if matrix is regular (all rows same length)
- Calculate row sums
- Add two matrices element-wise

**Key Concepts:** 2D arrays, matrix operations, utility methods

### Exercise 5: Matrix Rotation & Sliding Window
Contains matrix rotation utilities and implements a sliding window algorithm to count distinct elements.

**Key Concepts:** Matrix manipulation, sliding window algorithm, frequency counting

### Exercise 6: Sliding Window - Distinct Values Count
Advanced sliding window implementation with O(n) time complexity using only arrays and loops (no collections).

**Key Concepts:** Algorithm optimization, frequency arrays, sliding window technique, complexity analysis

## Technologies
- **Language:** Java
- **Concepts:** Loops, Arrays, Algorithms, Matrix Operations

## How to Run

Each exercise can be compiled and run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to an exercise directory
cd Exerc_X

# Compile the Java file
javac *.java

# Run the main class
java [MainClassName]
```
